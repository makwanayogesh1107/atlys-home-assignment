# Technical Approach Documentation
## Objective:
The goal is to create a customizable carousel that displays images (or more complex components in the future) with zooming and paging functionality. The carousel should:

Be created using UIScrollView and UIPageControl.
Dynamically adjust for varying number of images.
Feature a zoom effect on the central image.
Allow easy extension to add other components beyond images in the future.

## Components:
### CarouselView:
A custom view that holds the entire carousel implementation.
It includes a UIScrollView for horizontal scrolling of content and a UIPageControl to indicate the current page.
It is responsible for dynamically adding views (currently images) into the scroll view and handling the zooming and pagination as the user scrolls.

### CountryView:
A custom UIView that currently holds an image but is designed to allow easy addition of more components (such as labels or icons) in the future.
Each CountryView instance is added to the CarouselView for scrolling.

## Key Considerations:
### Scalability:

The CountryView abstraction allows future extensibility by supporting additional UI elements, like country labels or other views, without modifying the carouselâ€™s core logic.
### Responsiveness:

Auto layout ensures that the carousel adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
The dynamic sizing of the scroll view allows the carousel to adjust its height based on the available space.
### Performance:

Even though a UIScrollView is used instead of a UICollectionView, performance is optimized by only adding the necessary views to the scroll view.
Image views are only scaled when they are in focus, which limits unnecessary calculations.
Customization:

The current setup is highly customizable. Images can be easily replaced with other views, and additional functionality like auto-scrolling or infinite scrolling can be added with minimal code changes.
